AND OR AND XOR operator  --- study from google or books


now 
^(XOR)
        _
a ^ 1 = a

_
a =complement of a

 1010 ^ 1 = 0101

 1010 ^ 0 =1010 same number

 a ^ a = 0000 


 left shift operator  <<



 10 << 1

 first of all 10 will converted into binary

 1010 << 1 it will shift the number to left
10100 ->answer left the entire number in left and add zero at last

it will also double the number 10 after left shit becames 20

a<<1=2a

a<<b =a*2^b 



Right shift operator  >> 


0011001 >> 1 => 
 001100   answer the last number will be ignore for example in above case 1 is ignored..

a >> b = a/2^b



1011001 where 1 at last is LSB: least significant bit
